### ðŸ“‰ Possible Reasons Behind Attrition  

**Most attrition occurs among employees aged 26â€“35 (116 employees)** â€“ This group is often early in their careers and may leave due to lack of growth opportunities or better offers elsewhere.<br>

**Majority of employees who left were earning up to 5K** â€“ Low salary could be a key driver for attrition, suggesting the need for compensation benchmarking and retention bonuses.<br>

**Highest attrition is seen in employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds** â€“ These fields may have more market demand, leading to higher turnover if internal development or promotions are lacking.<br>

**Job roles with highest attrition:**<br>
- Laboratory Technicians (62)<br>
- Sales Executives (57)<br>
- Research Scientists (47)<br>
These roles may have high pressure, limited mobility, or more external opportunities, resulting in frequent job changes.
