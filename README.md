ðŸ“‰ Possible Reasons Behind Attrition

** Most attrition occurs among employees aged 26â€“35 (116 employees)** â€“ This group is often early in their careers and may leave due to lack of growth opportunities or better offers elsewhere.

** Majority of employees who left were earning up to 5K** â€“ Low salary could be a key driver for attrition, suggesting the need for compensation benchmarking and retention bonuses.

** Highest attrition is seen in employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds** â€“ These fields may have more market demand, leading to higher turnover if internal development or promotions are lacking.

** Job roles with highest attrition:**

Laboratory Technicians (62)
Sales Executives (57)
Research Scientists (47)
These roles may have high pressure, limited mobility, or more external opportunities, resulting in frequent job changes.
